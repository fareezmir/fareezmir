## Hey! 👋

My name is Fareez, and I'm currently a student at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. I'm passionate about AI, game development, and software systems.

- 🚀 **I’m currently working on** a coop project to help mute individuals using gestures to speak in languages utilizing Google API and another coop project in that of a memory game using 2 ESP 32s for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) individuals.
- 📚 **I’m currently learning** advanced AI algorithms, microcontroller programming, and software architecture.
- 🤝 **I’m looking to collaborate on** AI-driven projects, game development, and innovative software solutions. Shoot me an email at [fareezelahi@gmail.com](mailto:fareezelahi@gmail.com)!
