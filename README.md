## Hey! 👋

My name is Fareez, and I'm currently a student at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. I'm passionate about AI, game development, and building software systems. Currently, I am learning basic front-end developer skills to create fullstack projects. I am currently learning HTML & CSS fundamentals.
